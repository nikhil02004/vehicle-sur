# Vehicle Detection API - Issues Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied (Aug 24, 2025)

### 1. Database Connection Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Database authentication errors with "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'"

**Root Cause**: Multiple files had inconsistent database passwords:
- `config.py` had password "nikhil" 
- `app.py` had password "prateek"
- `main.py` had password "prateek"

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all database connection functions to use password "nikhil"
- Added explicit port 3306 to config.py
- Fixed files: `config.py`, `app.py`, `main.py`

### 2. Missing 'lap' Module ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "No module named 'lap'" error when uploading videos

**Root Cause**: The 'lap' package (Linear Assignment Problem solver) is required by Ultralytics YOLO for tracking but wasn't in requirements.txt

**Fix Applied**:
- Installed lap package: `pip install lap`
- Updated requirements.txt to include 'lap'

### 3. Database Connection Error Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'is_connected'"

**Root Cause**: Code was calling `conn.is_connected()` without checking if `conn` was None first

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated error handling in `app.py` (lines 178 and 235)
- Changed `if 'conn' in locals() and conn.is_connected():` 
- To: `if 'conn' in locals() and conn and conn.is_connected():`

### 4. Requirements Updated ✅ COMPLETED
**Added missing packages to requirements.txt**:
- flask-socketio
- paddlepaddle  
- lap

## Database Configuration
```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 3306,
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'nikhil',
    'database': 'numberplates_speed'
}
```

## Installation Status
- ✅ Python 3.10.8 virtual environment configured
- ✅ All required packages installed
- ✅ Database connection verified
- ✅ Application running successfully on http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Testing Results
- ✅ Database connections working in all modules (config.py, app.py, main.py)
- ✅ YOLO model loading successfully  
- ✅ PaddleOCR models downloading and initializing
- ✅ Flask application serving on port 5000
- ✅ Upload functionality ready for testing

## Next Steps for User
1. Access the web interface at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. Upload video files for vehicle detection
3. System will process videos and store results in MySQL database
4. Check results in the 'results' folder and database tables

## Database Tables Available
- `my_data` - Vehicle detection results
- `blacklisted_vehicles` - Blacklisted vehicle data  
- `settings` - Application settings (speed thresholds)
